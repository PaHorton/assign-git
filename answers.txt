What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
A gitignore file is used to ignore files that match a specified format from being staged via `git add`. 
For a Java project, you typically want to ignore files that have a class extension (ignored by *.class) as well
as jar files (ignored by *.jar). 

What does fast-forward in Git mean?
A file can be fast-forwarded there are no conflicting changes to it. For example, someone changes a file
nobody else has changed so it can be 'fast-forwarded' to the updated version. This is important for 
merging branches as you want to the branch to be merged in a state where it can be fast forwarded 
to the destination branch.

Why should you have different branches?
Different branches are important for version control. By keeping development branches separate from
master you ensure that the code that is readily available to people is always in an executable state.
Branches are also useful to keep track of the development of tasks as they can be worked on independently 
and merged into release branches when they are completed. 

In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
In a project it is typical to have one remote Git repository that you push and fetch changes from. In
our cases this remote repository exists via http on github's servers.
